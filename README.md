Getting Started
---------------

Run all the commands below in the root of the project. First, install dependency packages:
```
npm install
```

Then, transpile the TypeScript code into JavaScript:
```
npm run build
```

The command above creates a directory named "build" containing all JavaScript files and the static files needed to run the service. Now you are ready to run the sync service locally:
```
npm start
```
