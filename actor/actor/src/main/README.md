There's no Java code in here, because the actor project is only defining dependencies to the projects containing the actual code (base, selenium, appium, etc.)

This project also contains an "actor.yaml" file in its resources, which will be used by default when debugging Java code and the "actor.sample.yaml" file, which is used as the template config file by the command-line tools.
