# This test demonstrates two major features of OpenTest: data-driven testing and
# macro actions. Data-driven tests are created by populating the dataSet property
# with an array of data records to iterate on. The data records can be simple
# strings or numbers (as we have in this test), or complex objects with multiple
# properties.
